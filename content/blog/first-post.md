## Finally 

I had to get this blog out of my chest. I don't know why it took so long for me to do it, but I believe this is it, I finally did it and I'm not going back. 

Impostor Syndrome is something that always kept me from writing something or having a personal blog, but I have to overcome this fear.

This is my hello world.
